* Bio-informatic Algorithms
	The continuing quest to learn algorithms and data structure used in
	bioinformatics, and their implementation in Haskell.

	I am stuck with the same ideas, have not been able to break new ground.

** Plotting in Haskell
	 Plotting is essential in any scientific field. However Haskell is not
	 particularly helpful in producing interactive plots. We can take this as an
	 opportunity in  scripting our plots --- this requires learning more about
	 Haskell charts. Interactive plotting readily becomes hectic hacking away to
	 get the plot right. We can do the same if we have to script the plot --
	 however we will have to think more and the end-result of our efforts will be
	 preserved in the script. 

*** TODO <2017-01-06 Fre> center the GC diff plot around its minima.
